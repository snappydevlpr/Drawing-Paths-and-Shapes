#  Drawing Paths and Shapes

## Introduction
Based off the tutorial https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/drawing-paths-and-shapes
Users receive a badge whenever they visit a landmark in their list. Of course, for a user to receive a badge, youâ€™ll need to create one. This tutorial takes you through the process of creating a badge by combining paths and shapes, which you then overlay with another shape that represents the location.
If you want to create multiple badges for different kinds of landmarks, try experimenting with the overlaid symbol, varying the amount of repetition, or changing the various angles and scales.
